This is a screen keyboard shortcut cheat sheet. Screen is the must-have
productivity tool for working in the Unix shell.

It was created by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).  His blog is at

The cheat sheet was created as a part of my article "Screen VT100/ANSI
Terminal Emulator Cheat Sheet". This article can be read here:

The keyboard shortcuts are sorted alphabetically by the 2nd keyboard key.

You should at least know the following keyboard shortcuts:

    * Ctrl-a c       - Create a new window with a shell and switch to it.
    * Ctrl-a Ctrl-a  - Switch between current and previous window.
    * Ctrl-a k       - Kill the current window.
    * Ctrl-a n       - Switch to the next window.
    * Ctrl-a p       - Switch to the previous window.
    * Ctrl-a ESC     - Enter scrollback mode. Hit ESC again to quit.
    * Ctrl-a Ctrl-d  - Detach the window. To attach again, type `screen -r` in
                       the shell.

Syntax "Ctrl-a X" means "first press Ctrl-a, then release these keys and press
key X".

Syntax "Ctrl-a Ctrl-X" means "press Ctrl-a, then not releasing Ctrl key, press
the X key".

Have fun and be more productive on the command line!
